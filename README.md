Geospatial Food Video Discovery

Fudmaps is a platform to discover food videos in a geospatial way. Simply searching for a type of food will bring up several restaurants that serve it. With google maps integration, users can actually connect restaurants they see in videos with their physical locations, allowing users to eat their internet feed.
